# Thoughtful AI Technical Trial

Thoughtful AI wants a submission of a technical test for their job application. This is my entry.

Check out the requirements [here](https://thoughtfulautomation.notion.site/AI-Technical-Screen-d4d381a8c38d40fc9287cdb6c4f9992a)

## Setup

Create a virtualenv. I am using Python3.12, so use that:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv venv
```

I am using Chainlit to build the UI and black for code formatting.
